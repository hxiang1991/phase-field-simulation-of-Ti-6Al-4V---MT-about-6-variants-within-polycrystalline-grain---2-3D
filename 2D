This folder contains the matlab code of phase field models for polycrystalline of Ti-6AL-4V alloy in 2D under different conditions: nucleation, growth, external loading, plastic deformation.

Here the case of external tensile loading is uploaded, for the external compressive loading, the reader can change the applied stress by themselves.
