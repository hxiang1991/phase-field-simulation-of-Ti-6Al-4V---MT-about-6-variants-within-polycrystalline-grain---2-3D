This folder contains the matlab code of phase field models for polycrystalline of Ti-6AL-4V alloy in 3D with all possible conditions: nucleation, growth, external loading, plastic deformation and strain hardening.

The videos uploaded here is the phase field models of 3D about variants growth (but not nucleation) without local plastic deformation.
